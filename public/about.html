  <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, welcome to my website! My name is Brandon Rivera, and I am a graduate from Arizona State University who is a continuing student as a Software Engineer.</p>

<p>I have been working as an Application Support Engineer over the past two years. Working in tech has been an amazing journey for me, as its provided me a purpose<br />
and passion in my life. As I have progressed in my current role working with different developers and product teams, this has lead me to a new passion of being a<br />
web developer. As a current student at ASU and having been provided some on training learning from Carvana, I have been able to participate in creating projects<br />
for the company I work for, and free lancing oppurtunities outside of work to master my new skills.</p>

<p>When I am not working, I like to spend my days hanging out with my familly and pets (my fur children). Riding my BMX bike is another passion of mine that <br />
I love doing. On my days off you can catch me at your local skatepark riding and hanging out with friends, riding bikes and having a good time.</p>
