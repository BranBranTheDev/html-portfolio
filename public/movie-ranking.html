    <h2 >My Top 3 Movies</h2>
    
    <hr />
    
    <h3 style="color:whitesmoke">Avengers: Endgame</h3>
    <img src="../assets/images/ImagesMovie/endgame.png" 
        width="650" 
        height="360"
        alt="Marvel Avenger's Endgame Poster" />
    <p>This is one of my top favorite movies, as it brings all of my favorite heros together in one action packed film</p>
    
    <h3 style="color:whitesmoke">Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby</h3>
    <img src="../assets/images/ImagesMovie/Ricky.png"
        width="650" 
        height="360"
        alt="Talladega Nights Movie Poster" />
    <p>This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen by far, I could rewatch this and never get tired of it</p>
    
    <h3 style="color:whitesmoke">Coco</h3>
    <img src="../assets/images/ImagesMovie/coco.png"
        width="650" 
        height="360"
        alt="Coco and family playing guitars" />
    <p>What makes Coco in my top 3 is the story that is foretold in the movie, as it is inspired by Mexican culture.<br /> This is a well made movie that brings the art of mariachi music and 
    family together</p>
